# Guitar-Player-in-Java
The Guitar37 class has a total of 37 notes on the chromatic scale from 110Hz to 880Hz.  We will use the following string to map keys typed by the user to positions in your array of strings.  The i-th character of this string should correspond to the i-th character of your array:
"q2we4r5ty7u8i9op-[=zxdcfvgbnjmk,.;/' "
This use of keyboard characters imitates a piano keyboard, making playing songs a little easier for people used to a piano keyboard. The white keys are on the qwerty and zxcv rows and the black keys on the 12345 and asdf rows of the keyboard
